# LondonCrime


This data counts the number of crimes at two different geographic levels of London (LSOA and borough) by year, according to crime type. Includes data from 2008 to 2016.
This public dataset is hosted in Google BigQuery and the table has the size of 1GB.

The aim of the work is to explore the data through the use of BigQuery and to predict the number of crimes for a specific year, given the information about the boroughs, the total number of codes for each borough and the different major categories of crime.
